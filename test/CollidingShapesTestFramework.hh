/**
 * \brief Test framework for colliding two shapes along an axis.
 *
 * Uses collision_benchmark::GazeboMultipleWorlds to load up a Gazebo
 * server and client with multiple physics engines, and loads two shapes
 * into the world(s), one at each end of a "collision bar".

 * Two shapes are loaded, one at each end of a "collision bar". The collision
 * bar is the axis along which the objects will be moved to test the collision.
 * A slider can be used to step-wise move the objects towards and apart from
 * each other along the collision axis.
 * An "Auto-collide" function will move the objects along the collision
 * bar until at least one of the physics engines used for testing reports a
 * collision between the objects.
 *
 * The models' pose relative to the collision axis can be changed in order to
 * find critical collision configurations which happen when the models collide.
 * To change the pose of the models, the Gazebo client transformation tools
 * can be used.
 *
 * An additional helper tool to change the model pose is the "perpendicular
 * axis" which is the axis perpendicular to the collision axis. It can be
 * rotated around the collision axis and one model can be moved along
 * this axis. This is only an additional helper to transform the pose of
 * one model colliding with the other.
 *
 * A configuration can then be saved an loaded again at a later point.
 * The saved configuration will not save the amount the models were
 * moved via the axis slider or the auto-collide function, but only the amount
 * they were moved around by the user (with Gazebo client transformation tools).
 * Before saving a configuration, it is advised to separate the models to the
 * maximum extent using the slider, to get a feeling of which configuration
 * will be saved. The configuration saved is the one at which models are
 * separated to the full extent via the collision axis slider.
 *
 * To load models, the test can use:
 * - SDF files which contain the model
 * - The name of the model (it has to be findable in ``GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH``)
 * - Unit shapes: Box, cylinder and sphere
 * However, only exactly two shapes are supported, regardless what type.
 *
 * Note that the collision axis cannot be moved. It is not a model in the world,
 * it is only displayed as a helping visualization.
 *
 * More details about how the implementation unfolds the test configuration:
 *
 * 1. The two models are loaded and placed *at the origin* (which means
 *    poses which they may have in the SDF files are ignored).
 * 2. The two models are separated along the axis, such that their AABBs do not
 *    intersect. Model 2 is moved away from model 1 along the collision axis.
 * 3. The slider or the "Auto Collide" function can be used to slide
 *    model 2 along the axis towards/away from model 1.
 * 4. The models' pose can be changed and also saved to the configuration.
